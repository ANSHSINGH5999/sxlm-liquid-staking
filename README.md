# sXLM Protocol — Liquid Staking for Stellar

**First liquid staking primitive on Stellar**

Stake XLM → Receive **sXLM** → Earn real DeFi yield (Soroswap LP, future strategies)

Built using **Soroban smart contracts** and deployed live on **Stellar Testnet**.

## 📌 Overview

`sXLM` is the **first liquid staking protocol on Stellar**, allowing users to earn yield on their XLM **without locking liquidity**.

Users deposit XLM into a vault and receive **sXLM**, a yield-bearing receipt token whose value increases as yield accrues.  
sXLM remains fully composable across the Stellar DeFi ecosystem.

---

## 🚀 Why This Project Matters

Stellar currently has **no native liquid staking primitive**.

`sXLM` introduces:

- ✅ First liquid staking solution on Stellar  
- ✅ Converts idle XLM into productive DeFi capital  
- ✅ Fully composable receipt token (LPs, lending, derivatives)  
- ✅ Drives TVL growth for Stellar & Soroban  
- ✅ Foundation for advanced yield strategies  

**This protocol is a core DeFi building block for Stellar.**

## ✨ Key Features

- **Liquid Staking** — Deposit XLM, receive sXLM instantly  
- **Yield-Bearing Token** — sXLM value increases over time  
- **Instant Withdrawals** — No lock-ups or unbonding period  
- **Slippage Protection** — Optional `min_out` parameters  
- **Upgradeable Contracts** — Admin-controlled upgrades  
- **Security First** — Reentrancy guards, caps, pausing

## 🧠 High-Level Architecture

              XLM + Yield


---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User deposits XLM into the **Vault**
2. Vault mints sXLM based on the current exchange rate
3. XLM is deployed to yield-generating strategies
4. Yield accrues → exchange rate increases
5. User burns sXLM → receives XLM + proportional yield

---

## 📈 Exchange Rate Example

| Time     | Total sXLM | Total XLM | Exchange Rate | 100 sXLM Worth |
|----------|------------|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| Day 0    | 100        | 100       | 1.00          | 100 XLM        |
| Month 6  | 100        | 105       | 1.05          | 105 XLM        |
| Year 1   | 100        | 110       | 1.10          | 110 XLM        |

## 🛠️ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Rust (`wasm32-unknown-unknown`)
- Stellar CLI v25+
- Freighter Wallet
- Node.js (for frontend)

---

## 🛠️ Build Contracts

Clone the repository and compile the Soroban smart contracts.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ANSHSINGH5999/sxlm-liquid-staking.git
cd sxlm-liquid-staking
```

Build the contracts for the wasm32-unknown-unknown target:
```
cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```
Build the contracts for the wasm32-unknown-unknown target:
```
cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Optimize the compiled WASM files for deployment:
```
stellar contract optimize \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/sxlm_token.wasm

stellar contract optimize \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/vault.wasm
```
---
## 🧪 Run Tests
