## Why This Project Matters

Stellar currently has no native liquid staking primitive.

sXLM introduces:
- First liquid staking solution on Stellar
- Conversion of idle XLM into productive DeFi capital
- Composability with sXLM (lending, LP, derivatives)
- TVL growth for the Stellar and Soroban ecosystem
- Foundation for advanced yield strategies

This serves as a foundational building block for DeFi on Stellar.

## Features

- Liquid Staking: Deposit XLM, receive sXLM tokens
- Yield-Bearing: sXLM value increases as yield accrues
- Instant Withdrawals: No lock-up period
- Security: Reentrancy protection, deposit caps, TTL management
- Slippage Protection: Optional min output parameters
- Upgradeable: Admin can upgrade contracts
